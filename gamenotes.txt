new abilities > stat increases
semi-procedural exploration (some hand-crafted) > full procedural
ships have visible components colored by quality
minimum viable product > proof of concept

Some tasks:
  - improved resource loading (dictionary of textures, of fonts, etc)
  - modular ships
  - core mechanics: are they fun? (physics!)
  - minimal UI
